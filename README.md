# Weather Pico

A simple project using a Raspberry Pi Pico to fetch weather data from an API and display it on a 16x2 I2C LCD. Built in May 2023.

It shows:
- Temperature -> Feels-like temperature
- Date (MM/DD format)
- Humidity
- Cloudiness (e.g., "misty")

> Sorry for the blurry picture. This is the only one I have.
